## Frequently Asked Questions
Q: What does this do?
A: This is a standalone script that enables dynamic shadows in the front-end . This feature was originally only available for the Xbox 360 version of the game.  

Q: Is this compatible with Xbox 360 Stuff Pack?  
A: Yes, but "Xbox 360 Stuff Pack v2" has its own FE shadow implementation by osdever, and not all features may work correctly because of that.  

Q: Why are shadows missing in the safe house?  
A: This is likely because you're using "Xbox 360 Stuff Pack v2". The shaders from that mod cause many shadows to disappear, including those in the front-end. This is not my fault, there's nothing I can do about it.  

Q: What does "FE" or "Front-End" mean?  
A: It refers to the menu system and its various locations: Platform Crib, Customization Shop, Career Safe House, and Car Lot. These are all collectively known as the "Front-End" or "FE" for short.  

Q: What does "Fake" or "Pre-Baked" shadows mean?  
A: Some locations, like the Customization Shop, have static shadow textures that were used for 6th gen consoles. They don't move or react to light. They're fake. You should leave these off unless dynamic shadows are disabled.  

Q: Does this affect performance?  
A: No.  

Q: Can I bundle this with my own mod?  
A: Ask me for permission.
