## FAQ  
Q: What does this do?
A: This is a standalone script that enables dynamic shadows in the front-end. This feature was originally only available for the Xbox 360 version of the game.  

Q: Is this compatible with Xbox 360 Stuff Pack?  
A: Yes, but "Xbox 360 Stuff Pack" has its own FE shadow implementation, and I can't guarantee all features will work correctly because of that.  

Q: Why are shadows missing in the safe house?  
A: This is likely because you're using "Xbox 360 Stuff Pack". The shaders from that mod cause many shadows to disappear, including those in the front-end. This is not my fault, there's nothing I can do about it.  

Q: What does "FE" or "Front-End" mean?  
A: It refers to the menu system and its various locations: Platform Crib, Customization Shop, Career Safe House, and Car Lot. These are all collectively known as the "Front-End" or "FE" for short.  

Q: Does this affect performance?  
A: It shouldn't, no.
